# A Fractional-Order Epidemic-Infodemic Model for Marburg Virus Outbreak: An Introduction to a Novel Predictive Framework

## Abstract

This research presents a novel computational framework for modeling the complex relation between viral disease outbreaks and conspiracy driven misinformation spread, using the Marburg virus as a case study. We developed a coupled epidemic-infodemic model that integrates fractional order differential equations with deep neural networks to predict both disease transmission dynamics and conspiracy related search behavior patterns.

## Research Overview

### 1. Problem Statement

The emergence of viral outbreaks is increasingly accompanied by parallel "infodemics" - rapid spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories that can significantly impact public health responses. This study addresses the critical need to understand and model the bidirectional relationship between:

- **Epidemic dynamics**: Traditional SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) disease transmission
- **Infodemic dynamics**: Misinformation spread including conspiracy theories
- **Observable behaviors**: Digital footprints through search engine query patterns

## Methodology

### 2. Theoretical Framework

#### 2.1 Coupled Epidemic-Infodemic Model

Our model extends the classical SEIR framework with an additional infodemic layer:

**Epidemic Compartments:**

- S(t): Susceptible to disease
- E(t): Exposed to disease
- I(t): Infected with disease
- R(t): Recovered from disease

**Infodemic Compartments:**

- Sm(t): Susceptible to misinformation
- Im(t): Infected with misinformation
- Rm(t): Recovered from misinformation

**Key Innovation:** Bidirectional coupling where disease dynamics influence misinformation spread and vice versa.

#### 2.2 Fractional-Order Dynamics

We employ fractional calculus to capture memory effects and long-range dependencies in both epidemic and infodemic processes:

- **Memory Effects**: Past states influence current dynamics
- **Non-exponential Decay**: More realistic representation of recovery processes
- **Parameter Range**: Fractional orders α ∈ [0.7, 1.0]

#### 2.3 Observable Search Interest Model

Digital search patterns are modeled as observables derived from epidemic and infodemic states:

- **M(t)**: Marburg virus search interest = σ_M_I × I(t) + σ_M_Im × Im(t)
- **Z(t)**: Zombie/conspiracy search interest = σ_Z_Im × Im(t) + σ_Z_I × I(t)

### 3. Computational Implementation

#### 3.1 Neural Network Architecture

**Deep Bidirectional LSTM with Multi-Head Attention:**

- Input Layer: 7 features (S, E, I, R, Sm, Im, Rm)
- 3 Bidirectional LSTM layers (128 units each)
- Multi-head attention mechanism
- Output Layer: 7 predictions
- Total Parameters: ~1.25M

**Key Features:**

- Temporal dependency modeling through LSTM
- Attention mechanisms for feature importance
- Dropout regularization (0.3) for generalization
- Mixed precision training for efficiency

#### 3.2 Training Strategy

- **Optimizer**: AdamW with weight decay
- **Learning Rate**: Adaptive scheduling with ReduceLROnPlateau
- **Early Stopping**: Patience-based to prevent overfitting
- **Data Split**: 70% training, 20% validation, 10% testing
- **Sequence Length**: 30-day windows for temporal prediction

<!-- #### 4.2 Real-World Data Integration

- **Google Trends Data**: "marburg virus" and "zombie" search queries from India (October 2023)
- **Temporal Resolution**: Hourly data over 7-day period
- **Geographic Scope**: India (population-normalized) -->
